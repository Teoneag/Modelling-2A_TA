## Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) function

The travel time tti(e, t) of a vehicle i on an edge e at time t is given by the BPR function with a stochastic term as:


## Plan

- read statement: 15m -> 13
- chose simulation/visualization library: 5m -> 4m (Manim)
- setup + learn Manim: 1h -> 19m
- visualziation with Manim: 4h -> 2:15 (realized manim is not the right tool: can't move multiple objects at the same time independently)
- visualization with pygame: 1:45
- capacity for each road: 10m -> 45m
- step button: 10m
- style: better position everything, add icons: 10m -> 43m + 3:33 ->
  - Intensitate culoare pt trafic
- show at each edge the decisions: 20m -> 7m + 
  - modify this to show at each intersection where multiple routes are available the probability with wich each route is chosen (
