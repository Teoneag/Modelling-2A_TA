## Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) function

The travel time tti(e, t) of a vehicle i on an edge e at time t is given by the BPR function with a stochastic term as:


## Plan

- read statement: 15m -> 13
- chose simulation/visualization library: 5m -> 4m (Manim)
- setup + learn Manim: 1h -> 19m
- visualziation with Manim: 4h -> 2:15 (realized manim is not the right tool: can't move multiple objects at the same time independently)
- visualization with pygame: 3:20 -> 5:
- show the capacity for each road
- show at each edge the decisions
- style: better position everything
- Rmarkdown/Jupyter Notebook with commetns
